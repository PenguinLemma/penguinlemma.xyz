The room is white. The room is white and so is everything that belongs in the room. The bed, for example, is white. Painted metal. The bedclothes have some color, but only to remind ourselves that there is where we dream, and not outside their warmth and softness. In my case, they are also white to the touch of the skin when I close my eyes ready to leave behind for some time all the white in this room. And the rest of the space, if you ask me.

There are some clothes here and there. Sitting on the chair, hanging on the footboard of the bed: sometimes on the door handle or even from the door's top corner. They lay in the ground more often than I would ever recognize to anyone. They are not white, I like colorful clothes. They are not white, but neither do they belong on the room. They belong on any other place, but perhaps the sauna or the hospital.

The closet and the chest of drawers are also white. They have colorful clothes inside, but you can not see them. We already established that clothes belong outside. We keep them in the room only because we don't want to lose the boundaries between our dreams and everything else, ourselves and those that others think we are when we wear clothes instead of hanging them messily or storing them in an orderly manner. Clothes are only the physical appearance of those boundaries as seen from the outside.

The walls are all white and so is the door and the window. They constitute the part of the aforementioned boundaries, as seen from the inside.

The blinds (or their absence) and some photos on the walls are also not entirely white. They are here only to remind me of the existence of some place else on which all these other things - colors - belong.

The ceiling is fully white. No clothes or photos or skies on it. No color whatsoever. It is, in fact, the part of the room that defines it the most, what we see when we belong on the room the most. It is what I'm looking at right now. But I think I should (messily or in an orderly manner) put on some clothes, go to the beach and look at the see and the sky. That would match better the color I'm feeling.
